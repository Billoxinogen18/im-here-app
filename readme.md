I'm Here Android application uses Wi-Fi Direct and Augmented Reality to allow offline communication between Wi-Fi enabled Android devices in the absence of internet access through cellular or Wi-Fi access points. Augmented Reality allows you to locate your friends without the use of internet or offline maps! Imagine communicating with your friends on a hike, or while skiing, or locating them in a forest or at the beach. All possible with the I'm Here app.

## Getting Started

The build folder includes the signed .apk file. You can sideload the app by copying the file to your phone and installing it. Please ensure to allow apps from "Unknown Sources" for a successful installation.

To access the Unknown Sources setting directly, press the menu icon or button from the Home screen and tap Settings. Select Security (Android OS 4.0+) or Applications (Android OS 3.0 and earlier). You may need to scroll down to see the Unknown Sources setting. For Android 8.0+, tap Settings, then tap Apps. Next, select "I'm Here," then tap Install unknown apps and toggle "Allow from this source."
